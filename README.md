After the game starts, the player can control his tank through the keyboard. When the game starts, the window will show the player's tank and all the tanks it is fighting against. The player can only destroy the enemy tank through operation while preventing his own tank from being destroyed. The tank can be operated by the up, down, left and right keys. 3 bullets can be fired each time. When the enemy tank is hit, the bullet will explode and cause the enemy tank to be destroyed. If the player fires a bullet and there is no bullet or the enemy is not hit, the bullet must leave the game area before it can be fired. The enemy tank will roll and fire bullets in a random trajectory, and the latter must dodge these attacks through flexible operation. However, some walls will be placed on the map as obstacles at the same time. The player and the enemy tank must go around them, but the bullets will knock down the walls. For example, when the player destroys all enemy tanks, the game wins, and if the player's tank is shot by enemy bullets, the game is over.
